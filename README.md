# quick-laravel-installer

This tool is a Python script that installs the latest version of the Laravel PHP framework and links it with Valet, a development environment for macOS. The script prompts the user to enter a project name and then creates a new Laravel project with that name using Composer. It then parks and links the project with Valet and provides the URL of the project as a clickable link. The script also gives credit to the creator and handles the case when the user interrupts the installation process. This tool is useful for developers who want to quickly set up a Laravel project with Valet on their local machine.
